    "The results are expressed such that the individual can choose a neighborhood best suited for them based on their operational sweet spot, whether that be fast casual (Cheap/Moderate) or fine dining (Expensive/Very Expensive). Any stakeholder interested in opening a new restaurant in Manhattan can benefit from this analysis, but those who specialize in operating restaurants within a specific niche will find it particularly useful. \n"

Price in Foursquare is measured by the following scale: “Cheap,” “Moderate,” “Expensive,” and “Very Expensive,” all of which are denoted by \\\\$, \\\\$\\\\$, \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$, \\\\$\\\\$\\\\$\\\\$, respectively. The other variables are self-explanatory.\n",
